	ALSA Driver 1.0.25 Integration with Android
	 Linux Kernel 2.6.36 for Transformer TF101


This fork is being used to integrate ALSA drivers 1.0.25 which are based
on Linux kernel 3.2 and do not have Ventana board support with the Asus
Eee Pad Transformer TF101 which runs Linux kernel 2.6.36 adapted for
Android and AudioFlinger on Ventana board.

Feel free to fork this project further and/or contact me with any notes.
